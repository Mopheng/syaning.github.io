# Dawn: My Minimalist Blog System

<p class="meta">2015-03-15</p>

To make blogging simple, I developed [**Dawn**](https://github.com/syaning/dawn), a very very simple blog system.
Why I call it *Dawn*? When I got the idea I was enjoying [the song](http://www.xiami.com/song/2098665?spm=a1z1s.3521865.23309997.1.0toSAM).
You can get all my older blogs [here](https://github.com/syaning/older-blogs).

### Main Features

* static and no database
* markdown support
* all blogs are raw `.md` files, no need to generate `.html` files
* minimalism: no tags, no categories, only archives and custom pages

### Dependencies

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)(DOM operations and Ajax)
* [director](https://github.com/flatiron/director)(routes)
* [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)(Markdown to HTML)
